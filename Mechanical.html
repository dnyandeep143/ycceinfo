  <div style="flex-grow: 1;">
<br><br>Mechanical Engineering envisages the development, design, manufacturing and maintenance of machinery. The present age demands Mechanical Engineering specialists who have the capacity of adaptability and creativity in the new technical areas. Mechanical Engineers should have knowledge not only in their own specialized fields but also in wide interdisciplinary fields as well. To meet the above requirements Mechanical Engineering department offers the UG course in Mechanical Engineering and post graduate courses in CAD/CAM and Doctoral Program in Mechanical Engineering. The department has well qualified and dedicated faculty and is known for its high academic standard, well-maintained discipline and complete infrastructure facilities. The Department has 1) Siemens Center of Excellence in the field of Automation (ii) AVEVA Center of Excellence in the field of Pipe Design. The Department has maintained a good rapport with Industry and R & D organizations. The Department has students’ chapters of SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) and ISHRAE (Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers).
