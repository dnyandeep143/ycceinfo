<h5 style="background-color:lightgray; color:black">Civil Department</h5>
<div style="display: flex;">
  <div style="flex-grow: 1;">
<br><br>In past years, Civil Engineers focused on design and construction of new facilities, such as buildings, bridges and highways, water treatment and environmental facilities, foundations and tunnels. Today's Civil Engineer not only has to design new facilities but must also analyse the effects of deterioration on infrastructure elements, considering environmental and economic sustainability.

<br><br>Civil Engineers must be equipped with in-depth knowledge of traditional, fundamental principles and new technologies in order to address the complex, interdisciplinary problems faced within society.

<br><br>Being the oldest department of the institute, we offer a four-year course leading to the Bachelor’s Degree in Civil Engineering with an intake of 120, two-year courses leading to Master's degree in two major specializations of Civil Engineering as M. Tech in Structural Engineering with intake 18 and M. Tech in Environmental Engineering with intake 12. Along with this 03 programs for B. E. HONORS in Civil Engineering and 01 program of B. E. Minor in Civil Engineering.

<br><br>The department of Civil Engineering is an active research centre under the RTM Nagpur University and 30 Ph. Ds and 01 M. E. By Research degrees have been awarded and at present 18 PhD research Scholars are pursuing their research activities in the department.

<br><br>The department is having separate self-sufficient computer centre computers, printers, scanner, software like AutoCAD, STAAD-Pro, ETABS, Auto-civil, etc and also networking and internet facility.

<br><br>The department has produced several eminent Engineers who have made significant contributions in various sectors of Civil Engineering Field.
