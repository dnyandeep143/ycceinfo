<div style="display: flex;">
  <div style="flex-grow: 1;">
The Department of Information Technology is established in 2001, conduct B.Tech in Information Technology with an intake of 120 and B.Tech in Computer Science and Design with an intake of 60.The Department is also offering Honors Program in Data Science and Machine Learning, Cyber Security, Artificial Intelligence and Data Learning and Minors in Cloud Computing,Big Data Analytics.Department is an approved research centre of RashtrashantTukadojiMaharaj Nagpur University for the Ph.D. in Information Technology & Computer Science. The UG Programme B.Tech in Information Technology is accredited by National Board of Accreditation (NBA) in second cycle and also got extension for three year uptoJune 2023. The department has started Semester Long Internship for all final year students at reputed IT Companies. Most of the faculty members are expertise in the fields of Image Processing and Computer Vision, High-Performance Computing, Data Mining & Machine Learning, and Computer Networking. Faculty Members continuously publish papers in reputed journals and send Funding proposals to different funding agencies.The department also administers the student's chapter of Computer Society of India (CSI) for YCCE, and conduct various technical events such as programming contests; technical quizzes, web designing, etc. The student council SPIRIT (Society of Passionate Individuals Representing Information Technology) has been formed with the objective of the all-round development of students. SPIRIT regularly conducts co-curricular and extra-curricular activities as inter/intra college competitions. The Department has an 'AURA' student forum. Under this forum, we conduct various social causes activities like cloth donation, Blood donation, Book donation, helping poor background people, etc. Every year department published Magazine – “Maadhyam” and Newsletter – IT “NewsTrack”. With active interaction with the industry. Students are encouraged to participate in internship programs, research activities, project competition, and technical paper presentations. The department regularly organizes industrial visits, induction programs, student development programs, guest lectures, seminars, workshops, in-house training, webinar, etc.
