<h5 style="background-color:lightgray; color:black">Electronic & Telecom. Department</h5>
<p>
It is the Age of Information in which the Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering plays a vital role in almost every field. This contributes to the process of producing efficient and resourceful engineers by embedding the R&D capabilities of the recent trends. The primary objective of the department is to impart quality education, training and research at the undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral levels in various areas of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering with broad emphasis on design aspects of electronic systems. Here the students are given more practical exposures and innovative methodologies for the design and development in the electronics field, which is the backbone for all Engineering disciplines. It offers an excellent field infrastructure and study environment. It has well qualified and experienced faculty with areas of specialization in Wireless communication and Antenna design, Signal and Image processing, VLSI design and Embedded systems. The well-equipped lab facilities favor individual concentration as there are not more than two or three students in any practical group.
